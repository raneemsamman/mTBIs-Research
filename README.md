# mTBIs
Convolutional Neural Network on mTBIs

mTBIs are commonly known as concussions. They are almost impossible for radiologists to diagnose through MRI scans. Therefore, the diagnosis depends on a physician's examination of their mental capabilities and state.
This issue posses a great danger on the patients because they are often diagnosed at a late stage for receiving treatment.

This code was my research project in the summer of 2022 with professor Sara Jamshidi and a fellow student, Jovana Jovanovska. 

### The proposal won us a spot to be amongest the few projects selected for the compeititive data sciecne and mathematics scholarship, the 2022 James Rocco Scholars.

You can find the code in the file you just accessed. 
#### Note: I didn't upload the dataset due to its high privacy, sensitivity, and security.
